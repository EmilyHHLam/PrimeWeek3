=================
The assignment itself as will be given to the students is in the "assignment" folder. 
See the readme in that folder for the assignment itself

Exploring writing new prework assignments
=========================================

This project uses Karma to load any JS files in this repo (currently just `example.js`), and then run the tests that are defined in `tests.js`.

The syntax for writing tests is [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#getting-started)/[Chai](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#assert)

All of the mocha/chai functions are available globably via karma-mocha, karma-chai etc. This means you should be able to just call `describe(...)`, `it(...)`, `assert(...)` etc without importing anything.

All of this is very experimental and subject to change.
